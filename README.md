Hello I hope this project finds you.

As you you'll see, there are things that need work and other features I would need to spend more time on, like editing info, deleting info, displaying detailed views of form submissions and being able to add some more design elements to this website. I had a lot of expectation of how I thought this was going to look in my wireframe, however, nonetheless I've learnt a lot along the way and it wasn't only towards the end that I was just starting to get a hang of React and JavaScript.

I'm not completely impressed with submitting to you (and She Codes) this unfinsihed work, but I'm looking at spending some time before the Showcase to zhuzh it up and fix those dead ends.

Here are the details you may need:
