Hello I hope this project finds you.

As you can see - There are things that need work and other features I would need to spend more time on, like editing info, deleting info and being able to add some more design elements to this website. I had a lot of expectation of how I thought this was going to look in my wireframe, however, nonetheless I've learnt a lot along the way and it wasn't only towards the end that I was just starting to get a hang of React and JavaScript.
